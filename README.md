# Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-Computer-Vision
Hand gestures serve as a key way to communicate with people having hearing and vocal disabilities. Hand gesture recognition, therefore, plays an important role in making these peopleâ€™s lives easier. Sign Language Recognition which is a subfield of Hand gesture Recognition, helps us achieve this. Our aim is to propose a model that is intuitive and simple. We are proposing a sign language recognition model, which uses deep learning to translate sign language gestures to text and also compares the built model with other CNN models. For this, we would use American sign language from which we represent and understand the gestures.
